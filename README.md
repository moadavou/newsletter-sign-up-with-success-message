## Setup & Usage

After you clone this repo to your desktop, go to its root directory and run `npm install` to install its dependencies.

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run `npm start` to access the website's live server in your browser. You will then be able to access it at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

When the project is ready for deployment, run `npm run build` to compile the scss and sass files to css, minimize, autoprefix, and purge unwanted classes.
